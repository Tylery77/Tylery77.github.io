                        Despite Jiu-Jitsu's rising international popularity, there's a surprising lack of a
                        user-friendly application that connects the community and supports personal growth in the sport.
                        With the current state of technology, Jiu-Jitsu should have a digital presence to increase
                        engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although there aren't many Jiu-Jitsu-centered mobile applications, users may gather information,
                        tutorials, and other knowledge through different applications such as Reddit and YouTube.
                        However, with the creation of Oss Mobile, users can access everything they need to not only
                        improve their Jiu-Jitsu but also their life.

                        Currently, there are no mobile applications that perform like Oss Mobile. There are four main
                        competitors of the application, but these applications would be considered mostly aggregators.
                        Although these applications are not Jiu-Jitsu focused, many people still use them to access
                        anything related to the sport, such as news, tutorials, memes, etc. Oss Mobile aims to combine
                        all the positive components of these applications into one.

                        users feel, think, and say helps us create a user centric design that can cater to what users
                        want and needs. We created a empathy map for both men and women because we believe that they
                        have different experiences when training Jiujitsu. Since there are different experiences and
                        perspectives, we created two empathy maps and personas. </p>
