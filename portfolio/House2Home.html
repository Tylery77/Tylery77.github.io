                    <p>House2Home is a startup that helps users decorate their houses or apartments right after they
                        have just moved in. It focuses on having “starter kits” that contain a group of home décor items
                        that accommodate to the users’ wants and needs. The prices are fairly low since users have just
                        spent a large amount of money moving in.</p>

                        <li>Prices range from $10 - $50</li>

                        <h3>Behavior:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Ally graduated college one month ago, and has since moved into her first rented
                                apartment - a small studio in Chicago, where she lives by herself.</li>
                            <li>- Before moving in, she was really excited to decorate her apartment, especially since
                                it would be the first time living alone, with her "own" space.</li>
                            <li>- Ally browses Pinterest for ideas on how to decorate her apartment, and saves photos of
                                apartments and rooms she likes - mostly, small spaces that felt bright and lively.</li>
                            <li>- Ally puts time aside to shop for decorations for her apartment, but gets overwhelmed
                                quickly and decides to "do it another time"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Frustrations:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Ally knows the "look" she wants - but she doesn't know the right things to buy to
                                achieve that with her apartment.</li>
                            <li>- The photos she saves of inspiration usually have more decorative pieces than she could
                                ever afford. How can she get a similar look, on a budget?</li>
                            <li>- Ally wants to buy some decorative items that will have an impact on her apartment, but
                                she doesn't want to (or, isn't allowed to) make big changes like painting, or
                                renovation.</li>
                            <li>- Ally sees lots of small items she likes, but never buys them because she doesn't know
                                if they will look good together in her space.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Goals:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Ally wants to give a quick "facelift" to her apartment, without needing to shop for
                                lots of individual items.</li>
                            <li>- Ally wants to find decorative items in her budget that will give her apartment the
                                look & feel she wants.</li>

                        process and help solve this issue.</p>

                                as well as, look up other styles in the explore page. The website has designers that

                        wanted to figure out if there were any discrepancies when navigating through the application,
                        from both an UX and UI standpoint. Although this would be considered the final day of the design
                        sprint, the feedback received, would be incorporated into redesign and edits of the website.

                    <p>When conducting the testing, some issues that participants discussed were concerning navigation
                        and a lack of direction. Participants struggled to reach certain pages sometimes and were really
                        struggling with navigation throughout the whole website. Participants also discussed having a
                        back button where they can click to navigate to the previous page. Some other edits were to
                        eliminate the stenciled background and replace it with a solid color. There were also changes
                        made to both the color of the background and the color in buttons and texts. Although there were
                        not many comments about the visual aspects of the website, it is still important for us to make
                        sure the website is easily accessible to anyone. The color change was to ensure that most people
                        can see all the colors on the screen and to make sure that buttons and text are easily
                        distinguishable.

                        This design sprint was an interesting challenge that really pushed our skills and knowledge
                        within a short time period. It was also a challenge just trying to condense everything into a
                        day, and making sure that no time was wasted and we could streamline the whole process. We also
                        learned a couple more things from this project that we have to take into consideration for
                        future projects. This was also the first time we used Adobe XD, we wanted to tryout the
                        application in order to expand our skills. We learned the basics of the application and were
                        able to complete the prototyping without too many issues.

                        <h3>Simpler is better sometimes</h3>
                        <p>From our previous project, we wanted to include more artwork. But sometimes, it might be too
                            much and it might divert the users attention from the important features. It is important to
                            maintain a balance between everything in order to create an ideal project.​</p>
                        <h3>There needs to be flow or sense of direction</h3>
                        <p>​Users will sense that there is no sense of direction on an application or website, this will
                            lead them to getting frustrated and that is not what we want. It is important that pages
                            help guide the users with text, image, and other forms of communication. Our goals is to
                            help the user by creating a website or application to ensure that they have the most
                            convenient experience when reaching their goal or task.​​​​</p>
